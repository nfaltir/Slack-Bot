Common issues
------------------
yfinance is a useful but slow library, to circumvent this issue, data requests must be dynamic in nature (ex: current_price) <br>
fixed data, like ticker symbols, address, or data that only change every quarter (cash posistion) can be loaded into api app or a local db. <br>
Essentially, to avoid any issues you will need to split project into pieces. Too mnay requests can lead to yahoo finance flagging your ip,<br> causing slowdowns or no service at all. Websites with data tables are also implementing strategies to block web scrappers from scrapping their data<br> So a solution like Selenium or beautiful soup can work, but not its not a viable solution longterm. Ulitmately, the best solution is to get a finance api from<br> a reputable source.
